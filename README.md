# FullStack Mid Test

Hi! Despite the fact that you stopped a hiring process I decided to finish this task because for me SSR is really interesting thing so this assignment is a great opportunity to work with: Next.js, Styled Components, Github actions etc.

To be fair I decided to spend on the FE part only Sunday and Monday. BE part is not essential for me as I understand but I'm gonna do this tomorrow anyway :)

## App on vercel

<br>https://fullstack-mid-test.vercel.app

## Getting started

Run application on localhost:3000 :

```bash
yarn next dev
```

Run tests :

```bash
yarn test
```

Run linting :

```bash
yarn lint
```

#### FE Task

<br>✅Build a simple UI to list all characters using the mockdata provided and using the basic wireframes provided.There is mockdata for the character listing page and for the individual character page. The pages themselves have been added.

#### BE Task (i'm gonna do this tomorrow)

Create a custom rest API to pre-filter all required data needed. The required data includes getting all Alive, Morty characters along with all of their associated data types Origin, Location and Episode data from the Rick and Mort API. https://rickandmortyapi.com/. Please ensure you read the docs thoroughly https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation.

##### Please ensure your work checks all the points below – it’s what we will be looking out for

<br>- Your chosen method for fetching and aggregating data. (BE only)
<br>✅Chosen folder structure
<br>✅The layout should be based on the wireframes provided.
<br>✅Final work (whether complete or part complete) should be submitted in a git repository. (ideally we would like to see a commit history of some sort). With a README.md file, so we can run the app locally and test it ourselves.
<br>- For the BE task **DO NOT use the Rick and Morty JavaScript library**. We want to see how you architect aggregating data.
<br>✅The site should be built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript (TypeScript), and as far as styling is concerned: SCSS, Post CSS, CSS Modules, and CSS-in-JS are all encouraged.
<br>✅The FE task should be built using responsive techniques.

### Taking things further:

(Not a requirement but if you think it will help us assess your skill level and passion). If you have the time, here are some suggestions to enhance the app:

<br>✅Add eslint and a config
<br>✅Add prettier and a config
<br>✅Unit tests (only for just to check if pre-commit and github actions work properly)
<br>✅Use path aliases for TS
<br>✅Introduce a build pipeline using Github CI / Circle CI or other CI tools.
<br>✅Responsive images (FE task)
<br> - Performance optimisation (add a cache layer) - BE Task

### Taking things more further:

<br>✅Image optimisation with next/image to improve perfomance
<br>✅Pre-commit with linting and testing
<br>✅Styling for 404 and 500 pages
